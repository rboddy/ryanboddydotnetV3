Web dev, devOps, even pentesting.</p> <p>More importantly, I’m a family man, who lives for his wife and kids. When I’m not spending time with them, I’m playing video games, learning more about code, or working on some crazy, hare-brained side project - like <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Conquer-CSS-Fundamentals-Cascading-Beautiful-ebook/dp/B0B2MMG3C2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=ORKGEVSI29E&keywords=conquer+css&qid=1676750904&sprefix=conquer+css%2Caps%2C110&sr=8-1' target='_blank'>this book.</a></p> <p>I’m also a huge Star Wars fan, a type 1 diabetic, and a book worm.</p>"}/>
